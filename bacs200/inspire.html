        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>

        <p>Ever since I was young, my biggest inspiration has always been Stephen Hawking. Some of the most notable things about him that had always inspired me were his determination to succeed against all odd, and the notable scientific discoveries he gave to the world. If you are unaware of who he is, Stephen Hawking was a theoretical physicist who spent his whole life contributing to our knowledge on the Universe, but mostly our knowledge of black holes. At the age of 21, he was diagnosed with ALS and given only two years to live. He ended up living for another 55 years and contributed to the scientific community regardless of his disabilty.</p>

        <p>The theories he came up with are still being proven true today. He theorised what black holes actually look like, and in 2019 when we finally got a picture of a black hole, Stephen Hawking's theory of what they looked like was proven true. He is one of the most influential physicists humanity has ever had, and he still has plenty more theories to be proven true.</p>
